## Meeting notes April 11 python club
- Andrew would like to work with (stacks of) images, and with running tings on gpu's
- Ryan would like to work with clusters
- Jennifer would like to explore testing code
- Eleanor would like to find objects in images (edge detection?)
- Thomas would like to learn more about tracking objects in videos (deep lab cut?), and how to use AWS.

Last quarter we did not get to making a package, so that is still on the list.


Image analysis was mentioned a couple of times, so we can make that a common theme this quarter.

## Schedule for upcoming weeks
Not everyone was able to make it to the first meeting of the quarter, but if you come up with an interesting topic, we can move the schedule around no problem.

- April 18 Making a package (hosted by Ryan)
- April 24 Working with (stacks of) images (by Andrew)
- May 2nd Finding objects and edges in an image (Eleanor)
- May 9th Tracking things in videos, perhaps by deep lab cut (I volunteered Ellen. Ellen, is that ok? )
- May 16 Testing code (Jennifer)
- May 23 GPU processing (Thomas)
- May 30 Running this on a cluster (Ryan)

## Topic ideas for future meetings
- running things on AWS
- ....
