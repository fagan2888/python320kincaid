# Code Review
code: ControlU_from_CostJ.ipynb  
author: Thomas Mohren  
warning: code is still poorly written and poorly commented

## About the code
The actual goal of this code is a little hard to explain, so I'll do that mostly during python club. However, the script contains many small functions and plotting operations that are more or less standalone. The packages used are pretty basic, so hopefully everyone should be able to run the script right away. The actual simulation part takes about 30 seconds on my laptop.

## What I would like to improve
- more robust functions
- better naming of variables and functions so there's less reliance on comments
- make sure there's no errors in the code
- make plots look better
